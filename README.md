Dumplings!
=========

It's Monday, a quarter past midday. You glance up, look around, and ask the room: "Anyone up for dumplings?"

Your fellow dumpling enthusiasts are coming with you. You leave the building, cross the road and follow the path to The Long Dragon, just a bit further down the street.

As you enter the restaurant, the manager nods to acknowledge your presence and directs you to the large table at the back.

You sit down and do a quick head-count. It looks like we have 7 people today, cool. It's time to plan the group's order of dumplings.

It's your turn to order this time. Disaster. You can't work out how many plates of different types of dumplings you should order for 7 people.

Luckily, you thought ahead and downloaded **Dumplings!**, the app designed to help with this important decision.

After consulting **Dumplings!**, you sucessfully order 7 plates of dumplings for the table. Your fellow developers are impressed at your dumpling selection skills, and you owe it all to **Dumplings!**.
